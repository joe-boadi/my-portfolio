                            A passionate software engineer with nearly a year of professional experience. Armed with a BSc in Computer Science 
                            and Engineering, my focus extends to the dynamic realms of information security and leveraging AI to fortify digital 
                            landscapes.

                            ðŸ’» My tech toolkit includes Next.js, Node.js, and Python, and I revel in crafting robust software solutions 
                            that elevate organizations and delight clients.
                        
                            ðŸŽ§ When I am not immersed in code, you will find me immersed in podcasts or buried in the pages of a compelling 
                            tech book, staying ahead of the curve on the latest in technology and trends. I am an avid contributor to the software 
                            engineering community, always eager to share knowledge and insights.

                            ðŸŽ¹ Beyond the keyboard, I find harmony playing the piano and engage in various extracurricular activities that add color 
                            to life.
